# Nonlinear Filtering with Homotopy Continuation

This seminar was part of the master's course "Seminar: Von Big Data zu Data Science: Moderne Methoden der Informationsverarbeitung" at KIT.
I explored the opportunity to utilize the mathematical concept of homotopy for approximating the posterior in a nonlinear dynamic system.
